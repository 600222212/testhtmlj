    <h2> General Overview</h2>
    
      <h3> What CCD is </h3>
      
      <p class="p1"> Colony Collapse disorder is a major problem where many of the working bees in a hive just simply disappear with little trace and leave the queen, lots of food, and nursing bees to care for the young. This means that the hive will die because they need the worker bees for everything. This can cause major problems talked about later. These bees are dying and the cause is that they pollinate many of the farms around the world in the most developed countries the bees are kept in hives and transported around the country to pollinate many fields to get the food that you eat every single day in most things that you eat at home. These fields have farmers that do commercial farming so they will want to make as much food as they can and they do this by monocropping and selling to a particular market. They need bees to pollinate the crops but there are few left, so they have to be transported everywhere. <br>
      The bees are not having pesticide poising because they are usually piled up if that happens but these are spread out all over. There are many theories relating to the transport of the bees such as the possibility of the introduction of an invasive varroa mite that kills bees, too much change in the environment, too much change in locations, stress from transport, overstimulation from pesticides, poor nutrition, and probably a combination from above. </p>

      <h3 class="heading2"> Effect</h3>
      <p class="p2"> This greatly effects our natural environment and travels to affect every human on this planet. Bees are so important for every place on this planet because killing one part of the ecosystem can destroy the whole ecosystem along with others around the world. <br>
      But it has been shown that it isn't as devastating as previously thought. It could be since we still don't know what is causing it but the affects will not impact the world as greatly as we thought. But lets think of this in a worse case scenario where we never figure out what is happening and it gets worse and eventually the bees die. The biggest affect would be the food you eat since every third bite of humans is affected by bees since bees pollinate which means that it allows for reproduction among plants, this means that they are required to do that for a lot of our crops and a lot of fruits. That means not many fruits and not many vegtables either but corn and wheat and those stuff will survive because they are wind pollinated. That means that our diets will become even more by those foods and we will not get some of the nutriets that we need for survival that are in fruits and other things we eat. This means a lot more disease effecting people because of the lack of nutrients. Also cotton would dissappear which means no shirts or any clothing item made out of cotton<br>
      Another effect is the devastation of the ecosystem because all the crops that died out because of the lack of bees are foods for animals and if those plant eaters die the animals eating the plants will die and then every animal feeding or depending on that will die which means that there is not enough animals left in the ecosystem which would devastate it. <br> 
      Another effect is that the economy would have a severe downturn because bees contribute to $30 billion worth of crops which would destroy the global economy. <br>
      There are many more affects but we do not have time to go over them all</p>

      <h3 class="heading3"> Problem Solving</h3>
    <p class="p3">Many countries recognize this threat such as the USA which in 2007 the US department of Agriculture made a CCD steering committe which has made a 4 part action plan </p>
    <ol class="ol1">
      <li> <p>Collect data to determine extent of CCD and also the health of the current honey bee hives.</p></li>
      <li><p> analysis of bees to determine diseases or pests, stress and immunity, and exposure to pesticides</p> </li>
      <li> <p> research whether it is environmental or nutritional stress, pesticides, disease, pests, or a combination of all</p></li>
      <li><p> prevent further losses and improve bee health and environment.</p></li>
    </ol>
